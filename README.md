# Tera-Proxy-Modules

A work in progress list of modules from #proxy-mods in https://discord.gg/maqBmJV

easy to add modules to the list if anyone wants to extend on it, whats here is basically a demo test to see how it could look

# easy template
<tr>
<td><a target="_blank" href="GITHUB PAGE"><img src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/USERS_GITHUB_ID?s=96&v=4"></a></td>
<td><a target="_blank" href="LINK TO README">MODULE NAME</a></td>
<td><a href="LINK TO MODULE.JSON">[click]</a></td>
<td>MODULE DESCRIPTION</td>
</tr>

if you want to add things to the list just to help, I recommending doing a single persons modules at a time so you can easily keep the first line the same

to get the USERS_GITHUB_ID you can view their avatar and in the url of the image it will show there, the reason we don't just use that url its self is so its resized to fit the style better
